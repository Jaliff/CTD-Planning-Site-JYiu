  <img src="../Subpage wireframe2.png"width="400"height"300"/>
  <p>More space is opened up for changes. the use of the blocks is not restrictive and can depend on content of the page</p>

  <p>open space for development, side is used for quick access to gallery, which is arbitrary, as the link is just right above  </p>

  <p>-The basic idea of this subpage follows the same format as the homepage, with three editable regions that will be used for images or text depending on the subpage</p>
